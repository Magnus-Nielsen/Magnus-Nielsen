# Hi, I'm Magnus

I am a Ph.D. fellow at [Copenhagen Center for Social Data Science](https://sodas.ku.dk/) at the University of Copenhagen, with a background in Economics. My goal is to make the world a more data-driven place, using both predictive machine learning and doing causal inference using quasi-experimental methods.
